# 3D_interactive_well_path_plotting

This project harnesses the power of the Welly library to facilitate the loading, analysis, and visualization of well log data. By integrating data from .las and .csv files, we generate both 2D and interactive 3D plots, providing a comprehensive view of well paths. These visualizations are crucial for accurately analyzing well data and making informed decisions regarding well completion, casing settings, and perforation intervals.

### Key Features
1. Data Integration: Seamlessly integrating .las and .csv data files for comprehensive well log analysis.
2. 2D and 3D Visualization: Create detailed 2D plots and immersive 3D interactive plots to visualize well paths.
3. Depth Analysis: Visualize True Vertical Depth (TVD) and Measured Depth (MD) to understand wellbore trajectories accurately.
4. Interactive Plotting: Manipulate 3D plots for enhanced spatial understanding and data interpretation.
5. Data Validation: Ensure the accuracy of data through inspective plotting.

### Applications
* Enhanced Decision-Making in Oil and Gas Exploration thru accurate visualization of well paths. The ability to visualize True Vertical Depth (TVD) and Measured Depth (MD) in both 2D and 3D formats helps geologists and petroleum engineers make informed decisions regarding well completion, setting of packers casing, and deciding perforation intervals.
* Streamlining Geological Data Analysis by integrating and visualizing well log data, this project aids in the comprehensive analysis of geological formations. It allows geoscientists to interpret complex subsurface data effectively, leading to better resource estimation and planning.
